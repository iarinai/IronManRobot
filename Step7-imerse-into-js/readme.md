## Overview
1. Carefully read the requests 
    1. I know you are a genius and can understand everything on first read, but even Hercules had to do 12 works. Are you Hercules?
1. Copy/paste files from **request** to **student-work**
1. Change files in **student-work** until requests are met
    1. Practicly behave like a politician. Take my work, refine it a bit, then take credit of the ideea like it's your own

## Step 7-imerse-into-js
1. Ensure the html files is open in chrome browser
1. Open one assigment at a time. You have several *index[X].html* files
1. Press F12 to see the console whenever you are asked to check console
1. index-1-example-table
    1. A table of 3 by 3. So Venom can beat Spidy if they play tic-tac-toe
    1. Introducing a new script - jquery. Check line 5
    1. In style section
        1. We add a class to change the height of 2nd row
        1. We see how we can style all html elements of a type (td in this case)
    1. Be amazed by **Clear table**
        1. We declare a variable *$table* in the function, than use a pretty clear function it
    1. Be re-amazed by **Append new row** button
        1. Same old $table variable - one more time and we will become friends
        1. Declare and append a new row to the table
        1. Declare and append a new column to the new row
    1. You may even click the 2 previous buttons in any order and see the results
    1. Implement the 3rd button **The new button will add 2 rows and 3 columns** - and drink a hot chocolate in my honor for not making it a 10 X 20 request :)
