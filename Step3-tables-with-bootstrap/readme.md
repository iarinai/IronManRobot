#IronManRobot

## Overview
1. Carefully read the requests 
    1. I know you are a genius and can understand everything on first read, but even Hercules had to do 12 works. Are you Hercules?
1. Copy/paste files from **request** to **student-work**
1. Change files in **student-work** until requests are met
    1. Practicly behave like a politician. Take my work, refine it a bit, then take credit of the ideea like it's your own

## Same table, different approach
1. It's the same table as step2, only now done using a different approach (boostrap style)
2. only one hero is present now, as we hope Ironman came to life


## Step 2 - tables, bootstrap

1. add the 2nd and 3rd hero from step2
1. add the new column form step2
1. change header to be both bold AND italic (tip: check style section, google "font-style" )
