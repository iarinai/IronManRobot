#IronManRobot

## Overview
1. Carefully read the requests 
    1. I know you are a genius and can understand everything on first read, but even Hercules had to do 12 works. Are you Hercules?
1. Copy/paste files from **request** to **student-work**
1. Change files in **student-work** until requests are met
    1. Practicly behave like a politician. Take my work, refine it a bit, then take credit of the ideea like it's your own


## Step 4 - images

1. Check html file to see how images are displayed
1. Check what is the difference between 1st and 2nd row spiderman images (tip: also check styles section)
1. Notice there is a new structure folder
    1. styles - contains all styles for the project. We will fill this out later
        1. images - this is where we will store images for our pages
1. add a new row with a new hero and a corresponding image (tip for image: search a representative image, then copy it to styles/images folder)
    1. IMAGE COPYING IS FORBIDDEN FOR COMERCIAL PURPOSES. We are only doing this for learning purposes. For any comercial project please either buy or make your own images !
1. delete the 2nd row (huge spiderman image). On the 2 heroes left, adjust image size so resulting html is "pleasing to the eye"
