#IronManRobot

## Overview
1. Carefully read the requests 
    1. I know you are a genius and can understand everything on first read, but even Hercules had to do 12 works. Are you Hercules?
1. Copy/paste files from **request** to **student-work**
1. Change files in **student-work** until requests are met
    1. Practicly behave like a politician. Take my work, refine it a bit, then take credit of the ideea like it's your own

## Step 6-robot-design

1. Ensure the html files is open in chrome browser
1. Open one assigment at a time. You have several *index[X].html* files
1. Index-1-height
    1. Observe how height of the page is divided between the 2 divs.
        1. Play a little and make them 70-30, or 90-10
        1. Assign both rows same *class* of *twenty*
        1. Split the page in 4 rows of equal height. all divs must use the same *class*
1. Index-2-height-and-width
    1. Observe the new *b1* class (short for border1)
    1. Copy the row 3 more times and see how it looks
1. Index-3-robot-design
    1. in html, *&nbsp;* si view as space (Non Breaking SPace). It is also viewed as *developer space*. When you see this is means it was put on purpose. Pretty much like Ironman put the glove, or how "cap" left his best friend for a girl
    1. Make the grid 6 columns * 5 rows instead of 4 * 4 as it is now. Assign proper texts to the now *fat ironman*. Each row must have the same *class*
    1. Make the grid 12 columns * 10 rows
1. Next step, we will make 100 * 100 grids! MUHAHA
